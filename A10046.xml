            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>To the firſt I anſwered, that as vpon ſufficient deſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the pretended <hi>errour,</hi> I would recant it (ſince I ſought nothing but the advancement of truth) ſo I ſhould conſequently acknowledge that I haue giuen the ſcandall if I haue preached the errour.

                  <p>To the ſecond; that men might ſuſpect what they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and that it lay not in me to hinder every ſuſpition. As for the imputation of <hi>Popery</hi> in this point, it cleaueth vnto the Scripture, and all Antiquity from which (ioint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) I aſſumed this <hi>Popiſh</hi> doctrine.</p>

                  <p>PErfection is not abſolute in this life, but graduall; that is to ſay; men are perfit in a degree: ſome more, ſome leſſe, according to their cooperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with divine grace</p>
                  <p>To which ende, and purpoſe, there are <hi>Conſilia perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionis,</hi> Counſailes of perfection, as <hi>Virginity, Pouerty</hi> &amp;c. which remoouing the impediments of perfection, are excellent meanes to conduct vs therevnto; in as much as
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:15613:166"/> they withdraw vs from the loue of the fleſh and of the world, which are our capitall enemies aſſaulting vs with their continuall delights, and pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (being in the number of them, of whom the Apoſtles, by prophetick ſpirit, ſpake long before; that <hi>they would not ſuffer wholſome doctrine</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the adviſe of their Saviour; <hi>qui poteſt capere, capiat;</hi> they reiect the monition of <hi>S.

And whereas themſelues are now caried away with the evill current of this worſt age; they feare not, not only to diſclaime the <hi>Fathers</hi> but irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly to ſlander them,<note place="margin">D.

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it is that the plauſibilitie of the fift goſpell ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not to caſt any raines vpon the fervour of nature, but yeeldeth paſſage rather, and helpe vnto her precipitate courſe.</p>
                  <p>S <hi>Paul</hi> was of a contrary opinion; witneſſe his owne words, <hi>caſtigo corpus &amp;c.</hi> Antiquity was of another di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition; witneſſe <hi>S.

                  <p>Theſe things, being wholly oppoſite vnto the delicacy of <hi>Luthers</hi> ſpirit, are reputed <hi>Popiſh</hi> by him, and by his carnall ſectaries; whoſe ſingle faith (not clogged with the burthen of pious workes) can more eaſily mount vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Thus are they lulled a ſleepe in the cradle of ſecurity,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:15613:167"/> dreaming of a victory without any ſtriving at all.</p>
                  <p>If this be the way, vnto happineſſe, the <hi>Way</hi> it ſelfe hath miſled vs; our guides haue ſeduced vs; our teachers haue miſinformed vs: the auſterity of ſo many Saints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred in the canon of Gods word, and recorded in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender of the Church, hath beene practiſed in vaine; and the late goſpell is more profitable then the former.</p>
                  <p>But whether I may rely more ſafely vpon the firſt, or laſt; I remit me vnto the conſideration of any man, that hath the ſenſe of true piety lodged in his breaſt.</p>

So farre are we, from perverting the true meanes of perfection, as hath beene often anſwered, &amp; needeth no more to be anſwered, but that your odious <hi>Tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> doth expect ſome kind of anſwer.

And yet it is not the greatnes of the matter it ſelfe, but the manner of revealing, which tieth vs to a neceſsity of beliefe.</p>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:15613:175"/>
                  <p>I will inſtance in this preſent buſines. The diſtinction of <hi>Evangelicall Counſailes</hi> from <hi>Legall Precepts,</hi> is a truth to be accepted vpon neceſsity of ſalvation. Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſufficiently revealed vnto vs by God, and fullie propounded by the Catholique Church; ſo that it is either wilfull ignorance, not to know it, or extreame obſtinacy to withſtand it. But yet the Articles of the Creede, which are the firſt elements of faith, commended vnto vs by Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall tradition, may iuſtly be reputed more waighty, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the matter, which is handled therein; as namely <hi>the deſcent of Chriſt into hell.</hi> Which article of faith, is admirably perverted by the Miniſters in <hi>England,</hi> un ſo much as 3. or 4 ſondry opinions thereof are freely, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulably deliuered by them, vnto their ſimple flockes.</p>
                  <p>I might inſtance in their different opinions about the Sacraments, and other high miſteries of ſaluation, wherin fanaticall ſpirits expatiate without any reproofe. But I willingly pretermit theſe, and come to other particular points of doctrine, which I preached amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt them without impeachment.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, againſt <hi>Caluin</hi> his hereticall Autotheiſme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the vnity of the divine eſſence, I taught, with the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creede, and all antiquity; that Chriſt is <hi>Deus de Deo,</hi> hauing the ſame ſubſtance that is in the Father, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally communicated vnto him in his eternall generation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; with <hi>S. Gregory, Damaſcen,</hi> the <hi>Greek,</hi> &amp; <hi>Latine</hi> Church I taught, that Chriſt aſſumed our nature perfit, and complete in the very inſtant of his conception: contrary to the abſurd opinion of diuerſe <hi>Calviniſticall Proteſtants,</hi> who avouch that his incarnation was by te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall degrees, and not by entire perfection in an inſtant.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly; that God was only the permiſsiue, not any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſiue
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:15613:175"/> cauſe of ſinne; though <hi>Calvin</hi> blaſpheme to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and deride the diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Chriſt crying out, <hi>Deus meus, Deus meus, &amp;c:</hi> was not in a trau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; he ſuffred no torments of hell; died not by degrees (as though his ſenſes decayed by little and little) but in perfit ſenſe, paine, obedience, patience, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, conſtancie, he rendred vp his righteous ſoule <hi>a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> ſacrifice for ſin. But the common opinion of <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> is contrary vnto this poſition.</p>

Not as Man, for though hee did not know it <hi>Ex naturâ humanitatis,</hi> yet did he know it <hi>In naturâ humanitatis,</hi> as <hi>S. Gregory</hi> diſtinguiſheth. And this doctrine is contrary to <hi>Calvin</hi> his blaſphemous gloſſe; to wit, <hi>Chriſtus communem habuit cum Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis ignorantiam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe, and many ſuch like doctrines (directly oppoſite to <hi>Calvin</hi> his tenents) as he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to truth (for though his diſciples call him <hi>a great light of the goſpel,</hi> yet I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther approue the cenſure of D.

                  <p>Why then is this diſtinction of <hi>Precepts</hi> &amp; <hi>Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſailes</hi> ſo hatefull vnto the <hi>Calviniſts?</hi> Alas, it toucheth their coppy hold, moſt of them being either married men, or ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that way: and therefore let <hi>Sacraments, Chriſt, Church, &amp;c:</hi> be abuſed, nay let many points of Catholique doctrine be preached by Orthodox divines, yet they are

                  <p>For they that haue ſold themſelues to be the exact vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of their owne affections, and other mens wils, are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to provide againſt any thing right, or wrong; true, or falſe; which may be preiudiciall therevnto; rather atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what it is which will maintaine their ſenſuality, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what is orthodox in ſound divinity.</p>

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:15613:177"/> of this body, in the which the <hi>eſſence</hi> of the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſiſteth, his <hi>aſſertion</hi> is, that it was in an <hi>inſtant,</hi> not member after member, or lineament after linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in <hi>46. daies,</hi> as the conception is of other men.

                  <p>Thirdly, your rebukeable rebuke of <hi>Calvin,</hi> which vniuſtly you taxe him for, is eaſily anſwered. <hi>No doubt</hi> but that in the <hi>actions</hi> &amp; <hi>paſsions</hi> of vnrighteous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there is more to be deemed of God, then his bare <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion,</hi> for doubtleſſe, he hath his will therein: yet not in <hi>counſelling,</hi> and much leſſe in <hi>compelling</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, but in ordaining and governing them, in <hi>applying</hi> them to better ends, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <pb n="351" facs="tcp:15613:177"/> there are many things contained, more then the <hi>laws</hi> either <hi>commit</hi> or allow, as treaſons, fellonies, hereſies, &amp;c. which notwithſtanding the Lawes do order and diſpoſe of: ſo in the wil of God, within the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe &amp; and <hi>pale</hi> of his arbitrament, much more is contained, then either by action or authorizement from him, could ever be defended, and yet that <hi>will</hi> of his is the Iudge and diſpoſer of all thoſe particulars.

                  <p>SInce the controverſies of Religion are many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and intricate in nature, it was my deſire (from the beginning of my paines in the ſtudy of ſacred Theology) to finde out the true Church, that ſo I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre my ſelfe vnto her deciſion, and reſt within her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
                  <p>For which cauſe I wholly employed my ſelfe in turning ouer the volums of the ancient <hi>Fathers;</hi> and whatſoever I found clearely expreſſed by their vniforme teſtimony; I accepted that (according to <hi>Vincentius</hi> his rule) as the iudgement of the Church.</p>

And for proofe hereof, I remit me vnto the ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> wherewith I thought it meete to conclude this diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, ſince they that glory in the Fathers (&amp; wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t neither wit, nor learning for this matter) doe impugne this doctrine, and puniſh her profeſſours; how can I think that they doe not fight againſt their conſcience, and reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? And how can I thinke that any truth will finde enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement at their hands, when this truth ſo potent, &amp; ſo irrefragable: is thus fondly reiected by my <hi>Calvinian</hi> iudges?</p>
                  <p>But whome haue they condemned? me? a brother ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of their goſpell, a graduat of their ſchooles, a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of their Church?

                  <p>IN my peruſall of the ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call hiſtories, I did very often obſerue theſe two things.

Secondly; that ſhe had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to enact neceſſary lawes for the ſuppreſsion thereof; ſo that an Hereſie could not eſcape hir cenſure, nor an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke hir iuſtice.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Popery</hi> therefore be Hereſie, and <hi>Papiſts</hi> Hereticks (as ſome fanatically brand them) then ſurely the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>Proteſtanticall</hi> Church is able to ſhew, that ſhe, in all ages, hath impugned this Hereſie, and that ſhe hath her proper lawes to proceed againſt Hereticall offendours: If not ſo; then doubtleſſe ſhe is no more Catholique, then the furious Congregations of <hi>Donatiſts, Arrians,</hi> and ſuch like; who afflicted the true Church againſt all order of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, being neuer able to ſhew any Catholike predeceſſors, who maintained their opinions, nor any lawes made by them to correct the impugners thereof.</p>
                  <p>That this is the condition of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> I am a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by their diſorderly proceeding againſt the Doctrine, which I delivered out of the conforme teſtimonies of the Church.</p>
                  <p>For whereas it pleaſed my <hi>Calvinian</hi> iudge to call it <hi>Popiſh, erroneous, falſe, lying,</hi> abſurd Doctrine; they could not reproue it otherwaies, then <hi>Arrians,</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts,</hi> that is to ſay, by reiecting the Fathers, and by a tumultuous proceſſe, without any legall courſe.</p>
                  <p>And though I required them to deale with me as with an <hi>Heretique,</hi> by refelling my doctrine, and by procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Canonically</hi> againſt me; yet they oppreſſed mee with authority alone; hauing their will for reaſon, and their power for iuſtice.</p>

                  <p>But for aſmuch as I haue ſuch abundant proofe for the verity of my doctrine, and that their opinion is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Church for no leſſe then Hereſie,<note place="margin">Ambr. 10. lib. epiſt. epiſt. 80 &amp; 81.</note> (by <hi>Syricius</hi> Biſhop of Rome; and a Counſaile there: by S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Millain,</hi> and a Counſaile there) I appeach them confidently as Heretikes for embracing <hi>Iovinianiſme;</hi> as Heretikes for contemners of Antiquity; and therefore as Heretikes culpable of ſingular pride.</p>

                  <p>Though there be a very neere connexion betwixt the ſuperiour, and inferiour Magiſtrate, yet ſince all Magiſtracie is ordained for the conſervation of truth, and iuſtice aſwell in the Church, as in the common wealth (nay much more in the firſt, then in the ſecond) it is very requiſite, that the ſuperiour ſhoulde yeelde redreſse, where the inferior hath done a wrong; and that rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the cauſe, then the perſons, hee ſhould miniſter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity vnto both with an impartill hand.</p>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:15613:190"/>
                  <p>For which conſideration, when my petty iudges had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed me according to their owne humours, and paſsions; I appealed vnto my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi> his Grace; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Academicall ſoveraignty over me, and them (being our honourable <hi>Chancellour</hi>) and much more in reſpect of his Archiepiſcopall dignity; he being the Primat of our Church; perſwading my felfe alſo, that as he is more high in place, ſo he would haue beene more equal in iuſtice; and ſpecially in this cauſe, ſince his Grace hath ſufficientlie manifeſted himſelfe (and hath beene ſo generally reputed) to be averſe from <hi>Calviniſme,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tempora mu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tantur, &amp; nos mutamur in illis.</note> and my hope was, that his preſent place had not changed his former vnderſtanding.</p>
                  <p>To whom though I truely vnfolded the whole buſineſſe, and acquainted him with all circumſtances therevnto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, yet his Grace ſeeming to favour Calvins opinion (but how conſcionably, it ſhall bee now referred vnto the iudge of all the world; and he will reveale it in the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time) put me of with continuall delaies.</p>
                  <p>But his Grace had iuſt reaſon to expect a ſtrong reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in me; ſince I did appeale vnto him to doe me iuſtice only; and much more to giue his verdict vpon the doctrine it ſelfe.

                  <p>I leaue it vnto others to conſider, how his Grace ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth affected vnto truth; as for me, I truſt, that I haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a ſufficient demonſtration, on my part, that I would rather looſe my liberty of ſpeech, then that ſhee ſhould want my vttermoſt defence.</p>
                  <p>Here the indifferent Reader may alſo conceiue with me, that if my doctrine had beene liable vnto a iuſt cenſure, then ſurely his Grace would haue made no ſtay to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne it in ſolemne manner; eſpecially ſince it was ſo publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>But ſince this Doctrine was not ſubiect vnto his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, why then had his Grace ſo little reverence vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the eternall truth of God, and ſo ſmale reſpect of mee, that he would ſuffer it to bee ſo indignely cenſured by his vicegerent, and leaue me helpleſſe from ſuch iniurious op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion? his pretenſes to the contrary (if he haue any) are nothing but ſmoaky euaporations.</p>
                  <p>I am nothing, and worſe then nothing. But I pleaded for iuſtice. In what? In a point of faith. When? being vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently oppreſſed.

               <p>Therefore the doctrine of <hi>Evangelicall Counſells</hi> is not a point of Catholike faith.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> is cleere of it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proued already, and your foure evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences that follow, are evidently turned vpon your ſelfe. Thus <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts launce themſelues, and <hi>Saul</hi> falleth on his owne ſword. And in full ſatisfaction, that it may appeare to all men, that we ſuppreſſe not the truch, we reiected not the <hi>Fathers,</hi> for though by the rule of <hi>Vincentius</hi> and the graunt of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> &amp;
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:15613:191"/> all learned Papiſts, wee are only to receiue the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme conſent of the Fathers, yet in this you haue neither all, nor the moſt, nor any places pregnant for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> your doctrine, as is manifeſt by the anſwere to them and the interpretation of the <hi>Fathers.</hi> To your four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold evidence:<note place="margin">In praef. com. lib.

Fourthly, what <hi>Poſſevine</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things in the Fathers wherein vnwittingly they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented from the Church, are iudged and condemned.</p>
               <p>I could vrge for your foure, fortie of your own, that doe diſclaime the authoritie of Fathers: your gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Iurie is anſwered ſo fully by D. <hi>Benefield,</hi> that as no man can ſay more, ſo I hope it will make you ſay much leſſe. I denied not theſe 4 <hi>authorities</hi> you here bring but I deny that they bee applied to the preſent, for in all the courſe of your teſtimonies we denied no Fathers, but interpreted all.</p>
               <p>And now M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> LEECH, let me tell you, your vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueable Iudge doth ſee you, and wee both muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue our cenſure at another barre. <hi>Once,</hi> one church held vs in an honourable function, one Vniverſitie in a loving Communion, one Towne the flowriſhing and happy and chiefe Towne of our Shire, in a kinde
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:15613:191"/> participation of all good offices. But you are depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Now you are gone: you haue broken all theſe leagues, nay more, broken your covenant with God in the Miniſtry of his Church. Shame the Devil, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake your ſtepmother, ſatisfie the world, &amp; ſaue your ſoule. We ſhal wiſh you, but not miſſe you, &amp; weep for you, but not want you.</p>
               <p>Vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not amiſſe, good reader, for nothing is ſo contrary to the <hi>will</hi> &amp; conſent as <hi>error.</hi> Had theſe offers beene propoſed, theſe propoſitions had never beene refuſed.</p>
               <p>Firſt hee only propoſed out of a Popiſh, peeviſh writer theſe extracted, or rather extorted authorities and would never condiſcend to anſwer the point as a ſcholler in diſputation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it was diſproved by a publike lecture, &amp; it was maintained againſt him, by the Reverend Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors his Iudges, that neither Scriptures nor Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe fathers were for him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it was manifeſt that to preach Perfection in this life (eſpecially <hi>Angelicall integrity</hi>) was at the leaſt <hi>Pelagianiſme</hi> hereſie, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned by the Fathers and Ancient Church.</p>
               <p>Fourthly that this doctrine being the grounde of workes of ſupererogation, merit, &amp;c. was plainely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the poſition of our Church, as Doctor <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> in private conference offered to proue.</p>
               <p>The ſcandals therefore be full of iniquity, which you impoſe on the Reader, if hee beleeue your adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement.
